This is a stupid chrome extension that removes elements from the Feed when they contain the word "shared". 99% of the time, I don't care about Facebook memes and clickbait articles (even though Facebook just supposedly announced they are going to ban them). 

I already know this is stupid, but in the 3 minutes of testing I did it seemed to work. If this is useful to you, venmo me $1 and prove it.


I think the chrome extension will be downloadable here once it gets accepted: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/clean-feed/acjebhjdfoagigikeopkaadohklkklhl
